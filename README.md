Social-Startups
===============

This is where all the magic related to our social startups initiative happens! 

First, what does social startups means ? Well the idea behind social startups is quite simple, it's basically a nonprofit organization with the goal of creating social impact through technology. 

The goals of this initiative are : 
+ Make the world a better place
+ Build things that may have a good impact on the community
+ It's a great way for beginners inside our group to learn other experience members, and also for for experienced people to do some hacking and experiment with new ways of doing things!
